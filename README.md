# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description
This web application allows coding boot camp students to take a timed quiz on some coding fundamentals. Users can gauge their progress compared to their peers by answering multiple-choice questions. The application features a timer, tracks correct and incorrect answers, and allows users to save their initials and scores.
